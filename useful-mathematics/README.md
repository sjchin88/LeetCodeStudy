## Subset

The number of subsets for a set with length n is equal to 2^n (empty set included)

For a set with a specific element (minimum/maximum). Adding a new element to the set

The number of subsets with this element will double

## Combinations

number of possible arrangements in a collection of items where the **order of the selection does not matter**

**Formulaï¼š** C(n, k) = (n , k) = n! / ((n - k) ! \* k !)



## Permutations

When orders matter

Formula , P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!&#x20;

r = item taken for permutations

when r = n, the formula become P = n!

if there are identical items within n, then the formula need to updated to&#x20;

&#x20;$$n! / (a! * b! * c! ...)$$, where a! is the count of item a and so on.&#x20;
