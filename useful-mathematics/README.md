## Combinations

number of possible arrangements in a collection of items where the **order of the selection does not matter**

**Formulaï¼š** C(n, k) = (n , k) = n! / ((n - k) ! \* k !)



## Permutations

When orders matter

Formula , P(n, r) = n! / (n - r)!&#x20;

r = item taken for permutations
