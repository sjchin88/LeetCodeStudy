# Two Pointers

## Key Points

1. Reduce time complexity to O(n)&#x20;
2. Find circular/kth position / midpoint of a linked list (fast and slow pointers)
3. Iterate through the arrays to find prev\_min / max (Monotonic Queue / Stack)
4. Find target pair in an array (either sum, diff, or ratio)&#x20;
   * \-> Usually used pointers in the opposite direction
   * think of how the pointer should move (in one direction only) so that the running time is O(n)

## Useful Techniques

For a **circular** array, one transformation is to attach a copy of the array at the end
